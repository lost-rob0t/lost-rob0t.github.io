## Ring Buffers <span class="tag"><span class="lists">lists</span></span> {#ring-buffers}

Ring Buffers are just a Circular <Linked List>
its just keeping the last cons pair pointing to the first.

the solution to infinite looping is  you keep pointers to each node and stop if you see a node again.
